		<p align="center">Marty was born or appeared in Hill Valey, CA on October 21st, 2015.</p>
		<p align="center">Marty is a friendly, easygoing but accident-prone everyman who can sometimes lack critical thinking skills; he is nevertheless brave in the face of danger and can be very quick-witted and intelligent. He has shown some good and basic street fighting skills and often throws punches in hand-to-hand confrontations. He is loyal to his family and friends, regardless of whether or not he is estranged from them. His major character flaw is his pride, which causes him to take unnecessary risks to show others that he is not a coward. However, during a visit in 1885, when his ancestor Seamus McFly mentions that his brother Martin was killed in an argument after someone questioned his bravery, Marty begins to re-think his stance on what other people think of him.</p>
		<p align="center">By 2015, Marty's life has spiraled downward due to lingering effects from a hand injury that leaves him unable to play guitar. This injury occurs in 1985, after Marty accepts school rival Douglas J. Needles' challenge to a road race and crashes into a Rolls-Royce. In 1885, Biff Tannen's great-grandfather Buford goads Marty into a showdown, which Marty wins despite refusing to draw a gun against Buford. Once he returns to 1985, he remembers both this event and Seamus' advice and declines Needles' challenge, avoiding the collision that would have ruined his musical aspirations. Over the years, Marty learns how to make his decisions on his own terms instead of being influenced by others, thereby changing his future for the better.</p>
